## Essential Parts

Here's a rough shopping list of useful technic parts to get started with.  Some
of the parts are less useful than others, but I think all are more useful than
the technic parts I left off of these lists.

If you're using this as a shopping list, here's what I'd grab first (assuming
this is just for tinkering):

* Beams and thick straight liftarms of various lengths
  * 10-20 of the shorter ones
  * 4-8 of the longer ones
  * 2-6 of the bent ones
* A handful of the thin liftarms
* Axles of each length, skipping the 3L w/ Stop
  * 10-20 of the shorter ones
  * 4-8 of the longer ones
* Plates of each size, maybe 4-8 each
* A whole bunch of the pins, maybe 20+ of each except the tow ball and bushing
  pins
* Maybe around 10 of each of the gears, either from the bevel or the classic
  group.

The connectors are nice, but I don't think they're quite as essential to the
core mechanical creations you can do with technic.  They'll be useful as you get
more familar, in addition to components like the cam, chains, rack, etc

Notes: I'm mostly familiar with how the classic gears mesh.  The Bevel style
started coming out when I took a long hiatus from collecting Lego.  I think
they're more versital and I'd probably go with them if I were getting a bunch,
but I need more familarity before that's a strong opinion rather than a hunch.
